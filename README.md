**Description:**
  This is new project for telegram. Telegram bot, that incudes built-in file system. It's main differences are that this bot is easy for usual users. It's also light from the side of weight. The existing file systems like google cloud / yandex disk and etc. are very heavy and so hard for usual users. Also this file system is in telegram. It has a web part. In the web's side user mays register and manipulate it's account. It's more likely, that we'll add more different buns in future. Also 1 of the greatest advantages is that you are able to share viewing / editing separate files / folders with others by keys, that has every file / folder.
